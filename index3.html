                    Star citizen has been in development for nearly 6 years now and unfortunatly the game is still in early alpha. howevr when they first started the company Cloud imperium games 
                    didn't even have a base of operations to make the game. the video above is their weekly show where the present their progress in the games development to the fans. the first 
                    episode of this was filmed in chris roberts garage with just a single green screen. You can see how far they have come.
