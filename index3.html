                    Star citizen has been in development for nearly 6 years now and unfortunatly the game is still in early alpha. However, when they first started the company "Cloud imperium games" 
                    they didn't even have a base of operations to make the game. The video above is an episode of their weekly show where the present their progress in the games development to the fans.
                    The very first episode of this was filmed in chris roberts' garage with just a single green screen. You can clearly see how far they have come.
